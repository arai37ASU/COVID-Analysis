# COVID-19 Data Exploration & Visualization  
**SQL Analysis | Tableau Dashboards | Public Health Insights**

## Project Overview
This project focuses on **exploring global COVID-19 trends** using SQL to uncover insights related to **cases, deaths, vaccination progress, and infection rates**, and then translating those insights into **interactive Tableau dashboards**.

The goal is to demonstrate strong **SQL querying skills**, analytical thinking, and the ability to transform raw data into **decision-ready insights** through visualization.

---

## Business / Analytical Problem
During large-scale public health crises, decision-makers rely on data to understand:
- How infection and death rates vary across countries
- Which regions were most impacted
- How vaccination rollout influenced outcomes over time

This project answers:
> **What do the COVID-19 data trends reveal about global impact, risk, and recovery patterns?**

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **SQL**
  - Joins
  - CTEs
  - Aggregations
  - Window functions
- **Tableau**
- **Relational datasets**
- **Data Cleaning & Exploration**

---

## Data Sources
The dataset includes global COVID-19 statistics such as:
- Total cases
- Total deaths
- Population
- Infection rates
- Vaccination counts

The data is structured across multiple tables and analyzed using SQL queries before visualization.

---

## SQL Analysis Highlights
The SQL scripts in this repository perform:
- Global and country-level aggregation of COVID-19 cases and deaths
- Calculation of **death percentages and infection rates**
- Comparison of COVID impact relative to population size
- Analysis of vaccination progress over time
- Creation of views optimized for Tableau dashboards

Example focus areas:
- Countries with highest infection rates
- Countries with highest death counts
- Global daily trends
- Vaccination coverage by region

---

## Tableau Dashboards
The SQL queries were designed specifically to feed **Tableau dashboards**, enabling:
- Interactive global COVID trend analysis
- Country-level comparisons
- Clear KPI views for cases, deaths, and vaccination rates

📌 **Tableau dashboards are built using the SQL output views**

---

## Key Insights
- COVID impact varied significantly across regions when adjusted for population
- Some countries experienced disproportionately high infection or death rates
- Vaccination rollout trends show strong correlation with stabilization phases
- SQL aggregation enabled clear, scalable insight generation
